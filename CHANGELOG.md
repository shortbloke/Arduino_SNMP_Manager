# CHANGELOG for SNMP Manager For ESP8266/ESP32/Arduino

## 1.1.11

- Fixed implementation of encoding integers to use the minimum number of bytes necessary. Previously was always used 4 bytes. This Fixes #25.

## 1.1.10

- Fixed spelling error `Guage` now corrected all references to `Gauge`. This maybe a breaking change if for example you are were using `addGuageHandler` or referencing the type `GUAGE32`, which now should be updated to `addGaugeHandler` and `GAUGE32`.

## 1.1.9

- Added a new example file for ESP MCU to show polling of multiple devices and storing results in a device record array. #20
  
## 1.1.8

- Fixed #19 timeticks should be of type unsigned integer. This change impacts `SMNPManager::addTimestampHandler`.

## 1.1.7

- Fixes #18 support OID that use large integers, up to 4 bytes.

## 1.1.6

- Allow non standard port to be used when making SNMP requests. Default UDP port 161 can be overridden using `setPort(<port number>)`.

## 1.1.5

- Support longer OIDs. Change in v1.1.1 was incomplete

## 1.1.4

- Fixes #12 where additional check for packet length was incorrect and unnecessary

## 1.1.3

Focus: Increase robustness

- Better handling devices sending invalid packets in response to requests
- Better handling for receiving responses with OID that weren't requested
- Added DEBUG log messages to aid future troubleshooting. Just add extra defines `#define DEBUG` and/or `#define DEBUG_BER`
- Added support for using test data in `SNMPManager::receivePacket` to better support users experiencing issues

## 1.1.2

- Reduce max size of SNMP message on ESP8266 to address [reported issue](https://github.com/shortbloke/Broadband_Usage_Display/issues/4_) which triggered exception: `Exception 9: LoadStoreAlignmentCause: Load or store to an unaligned address`

## 1.1.1

- Improve OctetString handling for long strings
- Handle OID > 50 characters

## 1.1.0

- Initial library release
